# KaliDotFiles

This is my Kali Linux Scripts and dot files repository.

Scripts to turn on and turn off things a little easier from the command line...

And dot files to make the command line a little (OK really allot) better...

Please Note, Initial files are being copied from my extensive
  OSX dotfiles and will likely break your builds. I'll remove this once
  they are all corrected for Linux.
